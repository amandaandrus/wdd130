        <p>My name is Amanda Andrus. I live in Utah in the United States. I am an enthusiastic
            single mom of two little boys. I'm studying Software Development to get better job
            opportunities for my life with them. I love to travel, read, play games, try new things,
            and jam out to good music!</p>

        <p>Utah is a beautiful state with diverse landscapes accross it's regions. I particularly love where I live,
            because I'm surrounded by mountains and lakes. I experience snow in the winter and sweltering heat in the
            summer, but I don't have to deal with humidity. The air in Utah is very dry.</p>
